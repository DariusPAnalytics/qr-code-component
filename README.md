## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

How important classing and identifing your elements are to effective styling. E.g

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="card">
```

### Continued development

I need to imorove with flex styling as well as understanding different selectors for example height: 100vh, wth??? There are many ways to skin a cat and I have seen this done 3 different ways now. Understanding the best way is the challenge.
